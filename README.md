🤖 Agent — AI Automation & Multi-Agent Systems

A comprehensive portfolio of AI agents, business automations, and multi-agent systems built for real-world use cases across sales, finance, operations, research, and content generation.

This repository brings together practical implementations using:

n8n for workflow automation

Crew / Multi-Agent frameworks for agent orchestration

OpenAI SDK for AI-powered applications

🔹 What this repository includes
